Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

Neural networks are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns to perform some task by analyzing training examples.

An example of neural networks in the case of facial recognition is it may begin asking "is this a female or male?"

A convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
